# Questions
1. The first Linux tool you should check out is the very simple tool
free. First, type man free and read its entire manual page; it’s
short, don’t worry!
2. Now, run `free`, perhaps using some of the arguments that might
be useful (e.g., -m, to display memory totals in megabytes). How
much memory is in your system? How much is free? Do these
numbers match your intuition?
3. Next, create a little program that uses a certain amount of memory,
called `occupie_ram.c` This program should take one command-
line argument: the number of megabytes of memory it will use.
When run, it should allocate an array, and constantly stream through
the array, touching each entry. The program should do this indefi-
nitely, or, perhaps, for a certain amount of time also specified at the
command line.
1. Now, while running your memory-user program, also (in a dif-
ferent terminal window, but on the same machine) run the free
tool. How do the memory usage totals change when your program
is running? How about when you kill the memory-user program?
Do the numbers match your expectations? Try this for different
amounts of memory usage. What happens when you use really
large amounts of memory?
1. Let’s try one more tool, known as `pmap`. Spend some time, and read
the `pmap` manual page in detail.
1. To use `pmap`, you have to know the process ID of the process you’re
interested in. Thus, first run `ps auxw` to see a list of all processes;
then, pick an interesting one, such as a browser. You can also use
your memory-user program in this case (indeed, you can even
have that program call `getpid()` and print out its PID for your
convenience).
1. Now run `pmap` on some of these processes, using various flags (like
-X) to reveal many details about the process. What do you see?
How many different entities make up a modern address space, as
opposed to our simple conception of code/stack/heap?
1. Finally, let’s run `pmap` on your memory-user program, with dif-
ferent amounts of used memory. What do you see here? Does the
output from `pmap` match your expectations?
